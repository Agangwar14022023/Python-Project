# Airline Customer Rating Project#
This repository contains a Python project focused on analyzing customer ratings and satisfaction levels for an airline service.
Leveraging Python libraries such as matplotlib (plt), seaborn (sns), and other basic Python functions, the project aims to extract
valuable insights from customer data.

## Key Insights: 
** Total number of genders among airline customers
** Percentage distribution of satisfaction levels
** Classification of travel types (business and personal)
** Classification of customer types (loyal and disloyal)
** Comparison of customer types over satisfaction levels
** Analysis of travel class count over age and corresponding satisfaction levels

## Project Components:
The project consists of Python scripts and Jupyter Notebooks containing data preprocessing, analysis, and visualization steps.

Key components of the project include:
****** Data Preprocessing: Cleaning and preparing the airline customer data for analysis.
****** Data Analysis: Extracting insights and performing statistical analysis on customer ratings and satisfaction levels.
****** Data Visualization: Creating visualizations using matplotlib and seaborn to represent the insights effectively.

## Insights and Impact

The insights derived from this project can have significant effects on the airline's operations and customer satisfaction.
** Improved Customer Experience: Understanding satisfaction levels and factors influencing them can help the airline identify areas for improvement in 
    service delivery.
** Targeted Marketing Strategies: Insights into customer demographics and preferences, such as travel type and class preferences, can inform targeted 
    marketing campaigns to attract and retain customers.
** Optimized Operations: Analysis of customer types and satisfaction levels can guide operational decisions, such as seating arrangements and in-flight 
   services, to better cater to customer needs and preferences.
** Enhanced Loyalty Programs: Identification of loyal and disloyal customer segments can facilitate the design of loyalty programs and incentives to 
   reward and retain loyal customers while addressing concerns of dissatisfied customers.
## Data Sources
The project utilizes data collected from airline customer surveys or databases, containing information such as customer demographics,
travel details, and satisfaction ratings.
